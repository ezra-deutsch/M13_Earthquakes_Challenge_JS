# M13_Earthquakes_Challenge_JS - Module 13 - Challenge

### Overview and Purpose

The Disaster Reporting Network is interested in creating a visualization tool that shows earthquakes from around the world coupled with the tectonic plate maps to give context. We are tasked with using JavaScript and the Mapbox API to create and deploy this tool. Throughout this challenge we will be adding data in layers to create a multifunctional tool.

### Results

Tectonic Plate Data

### Summary

This neat tool gives users the ability to see earthquake data including location and magnitude from all over the world. The tool also allows to see different types of maps to give the user options to increase engagement. This was a complete success and hopefully will lead to more project deployments from the team at the Disaster Reporting Network.
